# Gatsby Sass Starter

Jumpstart your next Gatsby project with the power of Sass!

## What this includes
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
* [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
* [Resolve Src](https://github.com/alampros/gatsby-plugin-resolve-src)

## What this doesn't include
* A bunch of plugins that just complicate a quick bootstrap
* A bunch of components that you need to clean up
* Graphql that you don't need yet
* Stubbed files that you don't need yet
* Opinionated test and formatting setups (though both of these are encouraged)
